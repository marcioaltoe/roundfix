# Task 05: Run the final QA gate

## Overview

The authored terminal gate for this Spec. It declares what the matrix covers and
settles the Spec on evidence.

## Requirements

1. MUST run the repository Verification and record its result as a gate fact.
2. MUST verify that punctuated, emphasized, lowercase and preamble verdicts are
   classified, that both-verdict and no-verdict answers block, and that the raw
   answer is kept and named for every reached outcome.
3. MUST verify that a `claude` policy produces a review record with provider
   `claude` and that `coderabbit` is refused naming the missing surface.
4. MUST verify that a candidate carrying a Spec folder yields a prompt with its
   Decisions and a record naming it, and that one without a Spec folder is
   unchanged.
5. MUST verify that the shipped skill, its mirror and the guide describe the
   delivered behavior.
6. MUST verify that this Spec's own artifacts satisfy the promise rule.
7. MUST NOT accept a row whose only evidence is that a file was read.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Build the matrix from the Requirements above and the sources no
      declaration waives.
- [ ] Execute each row against the built tree and record its evidence.
- [ ] Write the dated QA Report with its verdict.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The QA Report records a verdict and names, in each row's provenance, the
      sources that row covers.
- [ ] The repository Verification result is recorded as a fact, not re-derived.

## Context

- instruction: `.agents/skills/qa-gate/SKILL.md`

## Verification

The following command is rendered unchanged from Roundfix's derived QA contract.
It proves a newest report exists and its verdict is readable; eligibility is
applied in process by whoever settles the Task.
